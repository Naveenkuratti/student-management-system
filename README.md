 # Technologies Used
Spring Boot: For building the RESTful API and handling the backend logic.
Hibernate/JPA: For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database.
MySQL: For the database storage.
Thymeleaf: For rendering the HTML views (if using Spring MVC).
# Implementation Details
1. Backend Setup

In your Spring Boot application, you will need to create:

Entity Class: Student to represent the student data.
Repository Interface: StudentRepository to interact with the database.
Service Class: StudentService for business logic.
Controller Class: StudentController to handle HTTP requests.
2. Frontend Setup

You might use Thymeleaf templates to render the student list.
Hereâ€™s an example of how you can set up your Thymeleaf template to display the student list:
